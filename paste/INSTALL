INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Making your own Pastebin

================================

Files:

index.html              - Presents the HTML form for pasting text.
paste.php               - Form handler that drives the rest of the process.
include/highlight.inc   - Syntax highlighting routines.
include/pastify.inc     - Takes syntax highlighted text and turns it into
                          HTML to be served when the paste is viewed.
include/createpage.inc  - Handles writing the HTML page to disk and
                          returning the resulting file path.

================================

Set up this directory structure more or less the way it comes out of
source control.

Update the config.php file to reflect your server and setup.

You may also want to make sure your web server has permissions to
write files into the results output directory (which is results/ by
default)

It is also a good idea to implement some sort of upload rate throttling.
This can be done by keeping track of pastes per IP address and shedding
load if it passes a certain threshold.

Additionally, if you wish pastes to expire after a given amount of time,
you will need to write a housekeeping script or cron job that periodically
cleans out expired pastes.
